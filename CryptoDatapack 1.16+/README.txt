<========================  CryptoCoin Datapack Info  ===========================>
			      Made by TitanPlayz

<==== HOW IT WORKS ====>

This datapack crates a fully scoreboard based Crypto currency called CryptoCoin, as well as a temporary currency called Coin, which can be replaced with another monetary system. 
The CryptoCoin price changes randomly, with lots of customisability. There is a menu accessible with a special item that can be accessed with a trigger command. 
When you mine dirt or grass block you gain 1 coin. This is just a placeholder currency system and can be fully changed and customised


<==== MENU ====>

Look down and click while holding the item to access the menu. The menu includes a buy option, sell option, your account balance, your CryptoCoin balance and the current price of CryptoCoin.
You can buy 1, 10, 100 and 1000 at a time, and vise versa. 
Everyone can obtain the menu item using this command:
/trigger ShopItem


<==== CUSTOMISATION ====>

There are three special trigger commands only accessible with a tag called "admin". Command to give tag to yourself:
/tag @s add admin

The first customisation is to the current price of CryptoCoin, self explanitory:
/trigger crypto.price set <price>

The next one will adjust the timer controlling when the price change, in ticks. 1 second is 20 ticks, so if you want a 10 second timer, input 200 ticks.
/trigger crypto.timer set <time in ticks>

Lastly is the factor of change. This means that the randomiser will choose from a larger/smaller array of numbers. If you set 5 in it, the value of CryptoCoin can increase up to 4, or decrease up to 4 (commands are weird)
/trigger crypto.random set <randomness factor>


<==== HUD ====>

Every player can access a HUD above their hotbar that shows their current balance, CryptoCoin balance and price of CryptoCoin.
/trigger ShopHUD


<==== Changes to world ====>

This datapack changes ONLY ONE block in the world, which is at 0 1 0. This sign is required to show the changing price of Crypto in the menu. This can be customised as well.
The datapack also requires 2 entites (area effect clouds, AKA markers) to be summoned, which are both invisible and don't affect the world in any way, but they are REQUIRED so don't use /kill @e. If you do, use /reload.


<==== EXTRA + CONTACTS ====>

Uninstall it using:
/function crypto.uninstall
